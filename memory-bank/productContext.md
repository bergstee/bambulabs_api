# Product Context: Remote Print Initiation for Bambu Lab API

## 1. Problem Statement

Currently, initiating a print job via the `bambulabs_api` likely requires direct interaction with the machine running the API, or through scripts executed in the same environment. There is no standardized way for a separate, potentially remote, User Interface (UI) application to command the `bambulabs_api` to start a print. This limits the flexibility and user experience for managing print jobs, especially in scenarios where a centralized dashboard or a more user-friendly interface is desired for printer operations.

## 2. "Why" This Feature is Needed

*   **Enhanced User Experience:** A dedicated UI can provide a more intuitive and accessible way to start prints compared to command-line or script-based methods.
*   **Centralized Control:** Users might want to manage multiple printers or a print farm from a single, remote application.
*   **Integration Capabilities:** Enables integration of print initiation into broader workflows or custom applications (e.g., an e-commerce platform that automatically starts a print when an order for a 3D printed item is received).
*   **Automation:** Facilitates automated print queuing and execution based on external triggers or schedules.
*   **Accessibility:** Allows users who are not physically near the printer or the machine running `bambulabs_api` to start jobs.

## 3. Expected User Interaction / Workflow

1.  **User Action (External UI):** The user interacts with an external UI application. They select a 3D model file (e.g., 3MF or G-code) and specify the target Bambu Lab printer (if multiple are managed). They might also configure basic print parameters if the design allows.
2.  **Command Issuance (External UI to `bambulabs_api`):** Upon user confirmation, the external UI application constructs a "start print" command and sends it to the `bambulabs_api` via the newly designed communication interface.
3.  **Command Reception & Processing (`bambulabs_api`):** The `bambulabs_api` application receives the command, validates it (including security checks), and then initiates the print job on the specified printer using its existing capabilities (e.g., interacting with `examples/print/print_3mf.py` or similar logic).
4.  **Feedback (Optional - Basic):** The `bambulabs_api` sends a basic acknowledgment back to the UI application indicating whether the command was received and accepted (e.g., "Print job accepted for printer X with file Y"). Detailed real-time status is out of scope for the initial design but can be a future enhancement.

## 4. User Stories

*   "As a remote operator, I want to upload a 3MF file through a web interface and tell a specific Bambu printer to start printing it, so I don't have to physically access the printer or its host machine."
*   "As a print farm manager, I want our central dashboard to be able to send print commands to individual `bambulabs_api` instances, so I can manage print jobs efficiently."
*   "As a developer integrating 3D printing into an automated workflow, I want a simple API endpoint to trigger prints programmatically, so I can automate our manufacturing process."
