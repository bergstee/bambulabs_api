# Progress: Remote Print Initiation Feature

## 1. Current Status

*   **Phase:** Implementation
*   **Overall Progress:** The initial REST API endpoint for remote print initiation has been implemented.

## 2. What Works (Implemented)

*   **API Endpoint:** The `POST /api/v1/print_jobs` endpoint has been implemented in [`bambulabs_api/server/main.py`](bambulabs_api/server/main.py:1), including support for filament/AMS mapping.
*   **Framework:** FastAPI has been integrated and used for the API.
*   **Dependencies:** `fastapi` and `uvicorn` have been added to [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt:1).
*   **Basic Authentication:** API key validation using the `X-API-Key` header is implemented (hardcoded key).
*   **Payload Validation:** Basic validation for mandatory fields (`printer_id`, `file_path`) and file type (.3mf, .gcode) is included.
*   **Print Initiation:** The endpoint simulates initiating a print job in development mode, with the ability to use the `bambulabs_api` client in production mode (adapting logic from [`examples/print/print_3mf.py`](examples/print/print_3mf.py:1)).
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for invalid input, authentication, and internal errors is present.
*   **Documentation:** Memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `techContext.md`) have been updated to reflect the implementation progress.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Implementation Phase)

*   **Refine Printer Identification:** Implement a proper mechanism to map the `printer_id` from the request payload to an actual `bambulabs_api.Printer` instance, especially if managing multiple printers. This might involve a configuration file or a discovery mechanism.
*   **Enhance File Path Security:** Implement more robust validation and sanitization for the `file_path` to prevent security vulnerabilities. Consider allowing only specific directories.
*   **Implement `print_parameters` Handling:** Define and implement how the optional `print_parameters` object in the payload will be used by the underlying print initiation logic.
*   **Implement Logging:** Add more detailed logging for API requests, validation failures, and print initiation outcomes.
*   **Add Configuration:** Implement a proper configuration loading mechanism for API settings (host, port, API key, printer details).
*   **Add Tests:** Write unit and integration tests for the API endpoint.
*   **HTTPS Setup:** Document or implement how to run the API server with HTTPS.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

*   **File Path Security:** Ensuring the `file_path` parameter cannot be exploited (e.g., for directory traversal) is a critical implementation detail. A clear strategy for validating and restricting file paths is needed.
*   **Printer Identification:** The method for uniquely identifying `printer_id` when `bambulabs_api` might be connected to multiple printers needs to be robustly defined and implemented.
*   **Complexity of `print_parameters`:** If the `print_parameters` object becomes too complex or varies significantly between printer models/firmware, its handling could become complicated. Starting with a minimal set of essential parameters is advisable.
*   **Placeholder Printer Details:** The current implementation uses hardcoded/placeholder printer connection details. This needs to be replaced with a proper configuration or lookup mechanism based on the provided `printer_id`.

## 5. Decisions Log (Summary of Key Design Choices)

*   **Communication Method:** REST API (chosen over WebSockets, gRPC, Message Queue for simplicity and suitability for the current scope).
*   **Authentication:** API Key in HTTP Header (chosen for simplicity).
*   **Payload Format:** JSON.
*   **Primary Command:** `POST /api/v1/print_jobs`.
*   **Web Framework:** FastAPI (chosen for performance and features).
