# Tech Context: Remote Print Initiation Interface

## 1. Core Application Technology

*   **Language:** Python (as `bambulabs_api` is a Python application).
*   **Existing Libraries:** The implementation leverages the existing `bambulabs_api` codebase for printer communication and control.

## 2. Communication Interface Technologies

*   **API Framework (Python):** FastAPI has been chosen and implemented for the REST API endpoint.
*   **HTTP Server:** Uvicorn is used to serve the FastAPI application.
*   **Data Format:** JSON is used for request and response payloads.

## 3. Security Implementation

*   **API Key Management:** Basic API key validation using a hardcoded key in the `X-API-Key` header is implemented. Future work is needed to make this configurable and more secure.
*   **HTTPS/SSL/TLS:** HTTPS is recommended for production, but not implemented in this initial version.
*   **File Path Security:** Basic file existence and type validation is included. More robust path validation and sanitization are needed.

## 4. File System Interaction

*   The API accesses files specified by the `file_path` parameter.
*   Basic checks for file existence and type are performed. Further security enhancements are required for path validation.

## 5. Dependencies

*   `fastapi` and `uvicorn` have been added to [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt:1).

## 6. Development Setup Considerations

*   The new API component is runnable alongside existing `bambulabs_api` functionalities.
*   Configuration for the API (host, port, API key, printer details) is currently hardcoded or uses environment variables as placeholders; proper configuration management is a next step.

## 7. Constraints

*   The solution integrates with the existing Python-based `bambulabs_api` application.
*   The initial security measures are simple but require enhancement.
*   The implementation assumes the `bambulabs_api` application is running on a system that can host a web server and has access to the 3D print files.
