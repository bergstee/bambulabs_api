# Project Brief: Bambu Lab API Remote Print Initiation

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to extend the `bambulabs_api` application to enable remote initiation of 3D print jobs. This will allow an external User Interface (UI) application to send commands to the `bambulabs_api` to start prints on connected Bambu Lab printers.

## 2. Core Requirements

*   **Command Reception:** The `bambulabs_api` must be able to receive "start print" commands from an authorized external application.
*   **Interface Definition:** A clear and documented communication interface (e.g., API) must be established for sending these commands.
*   **Payload Specification:** The command structure must include necessary information such as the file to print and the target printer.
*   **Basic Security:** Implement a simple security mechanism to protect the command interface.

## 3. Scope

*   **Initial Phase:** Design and document the communication interface and command structure.
*   **Future Phases (Out of Scope for initial design):**
    *   Implementation of the command handling logic within `bambulabs_api`.
    *   Development of the external UI application.
    *   Advanced real-time status feedback beyond basic command acknowledgment.

## 4. Key Stakeholders

*   Development Team (responsible for `bambulabs_api`)
*   Users of the external UI application

## 5. Success Criteria

*   A well-defined and documented API for initiating prints.
*   The `bambulabs_api` can successfully receive and acknowledge print commands via the designed interface (once implemented).
*   The design allows for future expansion and integration.
